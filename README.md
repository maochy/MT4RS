## An Empirical Study on Metamorphic Testing for Recommender Systems

### SUT 
* librec: https://guoguibing.github.io/librec/index.html
* Prea: https://github.com/jnhwkim/PREA
* Surprise: https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise

### Programs and data
For Librec and Prea, we added our code to their source code, which has achieved the purpose of testing. For Surprise, we tested by referring to its package in our code.
* librec-v2.0
    * program test entrance：src\test\java\net\librec\recommender  

    * MR：src\main\java\mr
      
 * prea-v1.1
    * program test entrance：src\prea\Main.java  

    * MR：src\prea\MR
  
* surprise-v1.1.1
    * program test entrance：methods  

    * MR：MRs
